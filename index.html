  <h1>Adversarial Agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning</h1>
  <!-- <h2>A description of the article</h2> -->

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <p>
    Adversarial attacks are a well-known phenomenon in machine learning that poses a threat to the security of many
    practical applications.
    To attack a neural network, one adds a small pertubation to its input, which leads to a misclassification.
    They have been studied extensively in the context of computer vision, and more recently in reinforcement learning
    (RL).

  <p>
    In an RL setting, perturbed observations can fool an agent with a neural network policy into taking actions that
    lead to poor performance
    <dt-cite key="huang2017adversarial"></dt-cite><dt-cite key="chen2019adversarial"></dt-cite>.
    For example, look at the hopper on the right, where the observations have been unnoticeably perturbed, leading to a
    detrimental drop in the cumulative reward.
    There is a multitude of methods to attack RL agents, including classical methods such as FGSM <dt-cite
      key="goodfellow2014explaining"></dt-cite>,
    and methods that exploit RL specific properties <dt-cite key="kos2017delving"></dt-cite><dt-cite
      key="sun2021who"></dt-cite>.
    The majority of these methods assume that the attacker is able to freely modify the agent's observations, which
    might not be possible in many cases.
    However, an interesting opportunity arises in multi-agent RL (MARL) settings, where agents observe each other:
  </p>
  <p><i>An attacker might take the form of an agent in MARL, whose actions directly influence the victim's
      observations.</i></p>
  <p>
    This is the key idea in Gleave et al's paper "Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning" <dt-cite
      key="gleave2020adversarial"></dt-cite>,
    who train adversarial agents that attack victims in several two-player games.
    In this post, we will take a closer look at those adversarial agents, analyze how they work, and discuss ways to
    defend against them.
  </p>
  <h2>Setting things up</h2>
  <p>
    We will train adversarial agents on four different mujoco environments, each of which implements a two-player,
    zero-sum game.
    Originally, these environments have been introduced in Bansal et al's paper "Emergent Complexity via Multi-Agent
    Competition" <dt-cite key="bansal2018emergent"></dt-cite>,
    who trained several agents competing in each environment.
    In the visualizations in the rest of the article, we will see the behavior of the first pretrained agent.
    For our experiments, we will focus on the following four:

  <p>
    The score you see above has the form <i>#wins - #losses - #draws</i>, from the perspective of one of the agents,
    which we will call the attacker.
    Right now, the attacker acts according to its pretrained policy, but later we will train an adversarial policy to
    act in its place.
  <ul>
    <li>In <b>You Shall Not Pass</b> the attacker is the red agent, who wins if the blue agent falls to the ground
      before it reaches the red line, and loses otherwise.</li>
    <li>
      In <b>Kick and Defend</b> the attacker is the blue agent, who wins if the red agent fails to score, but the ball
      remains within the vicinity of the goal.
      The blue agent loses if a goal is scored, otherwise it is a draw.
    </li>
    <li>In <b>Sumo</b> the attacker is the blue agent. If the agents had contact, and one of the falls to the ground or
      outside the arena, that agent loses. A draw is declared on timeout or premature stumbling.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Training an adversarial agent</h2>
  <p>
    While training the attacker, we keep the victim's policy fixed.
    This is not an unrealistic assumption, as in practice neural networks are often frozen before deployment, in order
    to avoid performance degradation due to retraining.
    Additionally, this simplifies our training setup, because our victim can be "absorbed" into the environment, by
    incorporating the victim's policy into the transition function.
    In pseudocode, this could look something like this:
  </p>
  <dt-code block language="python">
    class AttackerEnv(gym.Env):
    """ An environment that wraps a multi-agent environment and inserts
    the victim's actions at index 1. """

    ...

    def step(self, action):
    # Get the action the victim would take in the current state
    victim_action = self.victim_policy(self._get_obs())

    # Give the attacker's action as well as the victim's action
    # to the wrapped multi-agent environment
    obs, reward, done, info = self.env.step([action, victim_action])

    # Return the observation and reward of the attacker
    return obs[0], reward[0], done, info
  </dt-code>
  <p>
    Note that the environment now takes in only an action from the attacker, and returns only the attacker's observation
    and reward, meaning...
  </p>
  <p><i>The attacker can be trained in a single-agent environment.</i></p>
  <p>
    Our goal for the attacker is simply to win as much as possible.
    Therefore, we don't use the reward function of the environment, but reward the attacker when it wins, and penalize
    it otherwise.
    We do this by giving a sparse reward at the end of the episode, either 1000 or -1000 depending on the game result.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the environment and reward in place, we can use any standard RL algorithm to train our attacker.
    In our case, we used the PPO implementation of stable baselines 3 <dt-cite key="stable-baselines3"></dt-cite>
    with the hyperparameters provided in <dt-cite key="gleave2020adversarial"></dt-cite>.

  <p>
    In <b>You shall not pass</b>, the attacker is able to consistently score wins (it wins 71% of the games).
    It does this not by obstructing the victim, or by any other interpretable means, but by falling to the ground and
    moving seemingly at random.
    This shows that the attacker produces adversarial observations, because the victim cannot cross the line despite any
    obstruction.
    This is not the case when placing the victim against a random policy, or one that does not exert forces on its
    joints at all (the zero policy).
  </p>

    <div class="figure">

      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    In <b>Kick and Defend</b>, the attacker achieves even better results against the victim (winning 81% of the games).
    While the behavior of the attacker seems similar to the one in You Shall Not Pass, the effect it has on the victim
    is different.
    Instead of falling over, the victim seems to forget to kick the ball, resulting in a loss after the time limit is
    reached.
    Again, pairing up the victim against the random policy or the zero policy, it performs as expected.

      </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    In <b>Sumo</b>, our attacks work fairly well, but the results differ a lot between the victims.
    While our first attacker can score a 70% winrate, the second and third only win 12% and 36%, respectively.
    Because the attacker cannot win when falling over, it learns to kneel in a stable position, while moving its arms.
    The constraint of staying upright limits the impact the attacker can have on the victim, which could explain the
    high variance in the attackers performance.

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    In <b>Sumo (ants)</b> our attack did not work against any of the victims.
    This is in line with the research on adversarial attacks, which shows that they work better in higher-dimensional
    input spaces <dt-cite key="goodfellow2014explaining"></dt-cite>.
    In comparison, the state of an ant agent is 15-dimensional, while that of a human is 24-dimensional.
    Still, we can observe that the attacker seems to stall the victim, while almost not moving itself.
    This is a vastly differnt behavior than that of the pretrained agents.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all, we can gather two key takeaways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>It is easy to create adversarial agents by simply training to minimize the success of a victim.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>
        The success of the attack depends on how much control the attacker has over the victim's observation space
        (or in other words, the effective dimensionality of the manipulable subspace).
      </i>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While the results we presented here are purely qualitative and visual, we provide a complete table of winrates in
    the <a href="#appendix">appendix</a>.
    Still, you might be unsatisfied, because while we have seen that the attacks work, we have not seen <i>how</i> they
    work.
  </p>


  <h2>
    How do the adversarial attacks work?
  </h2>
  <!--<p>
    
      In order to understand the mode of action of our attacks, we will analyze the activations in the victim's policy network.
      To do so, we will use two techniques, TSNE <dt-cite key="vandermaaten2008visualizing"></dt-cite> for a qualitative visualizations and a Gaussian mixture model
      <dt-cite key="pedregosa2011gaussian"></dt-cite> for a statistical analysis. 
    # * If we think about the implications of our training one assumptions could be that
    * Trying to understand how the adv attack work
    * the easiest way to win against a well trained agent in little time, is to create observerations that the defender has never seen before and that are very different from the observations that the defender has seen during training
    * Therefore the attack is looking to create input for defender on in an observation space that the defender has not well generalized before
    * One intuation that we have is, that the activations of semantically similar observations are close to each other in the networks representation and 
    * Therefore we need to open up the black box of the defender and take a look into the inner workings of the defender
    * one possibilitiy to do this, is by looking at the activations of the defender during the games
    * we can do this by using the TSNE algorithm to visualize the activations of the defender in a 2D space
    * TSNE is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that tries to preserve the local structure of the data

  </figure>

  <p>
    We suspect that the easiest way to win against a well-trained agent in a short time is to create observations that
    the defender has not encountered during training.
    The attack aims to create inputs for the defender in an observation space that the defender has not well generalized
    before.
    To validate if this assumption is correct we are required to open up the black box of the defender and analyze its
    inner workings.

    One intuitive approach to achieve this is to examine the activations of semantically similar observations, which are
    expected to be close to each other in the network's representation.
    By analyzing the activations of the defender during the game, we can gain insight into how it processes different
    observations.

    To visualize the activations of the defender in a 2D space, we used the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
    (T-SNE)<dt-cite key="vandermaaten2008visualizing"></dt-cite> algorithm, which is a dimensionality reduction
    technique that preserves the local structure of the data.
    This allows us to gain a better understanding of how the defender perceives the game environment and how it responds
    to different stimuli.

      <b>Log-likelihood</b> of a models activation to originate from the Gaussian mixture model fitted onto Zoo1's
      activation.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The T-SNE visualization shows that the attacker is able to create observations that stimulate the defender
    differently than the Zoo models.
    As this is a strictly qualitative analysis, we cannot draw any numeric conclusions from this visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we also performed a statistical analysis of the defender's activations.
    This analysis is done by modeling the defender's activations when playing against the one of the Zoo models as a
    Gaussian mixture model<dt-cite key="pedregosa2011gaussian"></dt-cite>.

    When comparing the activations induced by the other Zoo models we can observer that there is a weak positive log
    likelihood, that these activations where produced by the same model.
    However in most of the cases it was strongly unlikely, that the activations induced by the adversarial agent were
    produced by the same model.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How can we defend against adversarial agents?
  </h2>
  <p>
    As we have seen, the enabler for adversarial attacks is the manipulation of the victim's observation space.
    Therefore, how can we defend against such attacks?
    A super simple solution is to mask out the part of the observations that contains information about the attacker.
    For masking, we fix the values after initializing the agents within the environment so that they stay natural,
    unlike setting them to 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    This technique works extremely well for "You Shall Not Pass," where the win rate against the adversary skyrockets to
    99.2%.
    However, it does come at a cost: the performance against the pretrained opponent drops from 50.9% to 19.3%.
    Additionally, this method of masking does not work for other environments whose observations contain positions
    relative to the victim.
    When the victim moves, it still observes the same relative position, which we believe is detrimental to its
    performance.
    Besides this very simple method, there are many other ways to defend against adversarial agents.
  </p>
  <p>
    One idea is <b>finetuning</b> a policy against adversarial attacks, such as in <dt-cite
      key="kos2017delving"></dt-cite>,
    where the authors increase a policies robustness by finetuning against observations attacked with FGSM.
    Similarly, in <td-cite key="gleave2020adversarial"></td-cite>, the victim agents are finetuned against the
    attackers,
    which increases robustness while the attack can still be reapplied.
  </p>
  <p>
    A related approach is <b>co-training</b> with adversarial agents.
    Here, the victim is trained at the same time as an adversary which can manipulate the victim's observations,
    building robustness from the ground up.
    In <dt-cite key="pinto2017robust"></dt-cite>, the co-trained adversarial agent applies forces to the victim in order
    to destabelize it.
    In <dt-cite key="zhang2021robust"></dt-cite>, the authors co-train an optimal adversary represented by a neural
    network that outputs an observation.
    This might be infeasible in large observation spaces, and is improved upon in <dt-cite key="sun2022who"></dt-cite>,
    who split this network into an actor and director,
    which craft a state perturbation and propose a policy perturbation direction, respectively.
    Another approach is to co-train with adversarial agents, which is done in <dt-cite
      key="czempin2022reducing"></dt-cite>, where the authors train a victim with a diverse population of different
    opponents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, there are several <b>regularization</b> methods, such as <dt-cite key="oikarinen2021robust"></dt-cite> and
    <dt-cite key="zhang2020robust"></dt-cite>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Discussion">Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    In the high dimensional environments (sumo humans, kick and defend, you shall not pass) our experiments showed that
    adversarial policies can prove as strong opponents in only a fraction of the training time.
    Despite the success on these environment, in the low dimensional environment (sumo ants) the adversarial agent could
    not prove successfull very often.
    This makes sense, since the combinatorical explosion of possible states in the higher dimensional environments makes
    it more likely, that there are observation states which were not visited in the training process and not generalized
    yet.

    In the paper <dt-cite key="gleave2020adversarial"></dt-cite> an effective measure for protecting against the
    adversarial attacks was found in masking out the position of the pretrained Zoo-models. In our studies we could not
    replicate these results. We attribute this to a detail in the implementation of the masking. In <dt-cite
      key="gleave2020adversarial"></dt-cite> the authors did not set the masked values to a fixed value and kept it
    static
    throughout a run, but instead updated the relative position with respect to the movement of the agent. Since this is
    an inplausible setup for a black box environment we kept a static value throughout the run. With this change, we
    were not able to see the same results as in the paper, but had to notice a significant drop in performance against
    all the other models, with a winrate of less then 4% against every model.
