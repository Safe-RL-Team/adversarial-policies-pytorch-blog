  <h1>Adversarial Agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning</h1>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <p>
    Adversarial attacks are a well-known phenomenon in machine learning that poses a threat to the security of many practical applications.
    To attack a neural network, one adds a small pertubation to its input, which leads to a misclassification.
    They have been studied extensively in the context of computer vision, and more recently in reinforcement learning (RL).

    In an RL setting, perturbed observations can fool an agent with a neural network policy into taking actions that lead to poor performance
    <dt-cite key="huang2017adversarial"></dt-cite><dt-cite key="chen2019adversarial"></dt-cite>.
    For example, look at the hopper on the right, where the observations have been unnoticeably perturbed, leading to a detrimental drop in the cumulative reward.
    There is a multitude of methods to attack RL agents, including classical methods such as FGSM <dt-cite key="goodfellow2014explaining"></dt-cite>,
    and methods that exploit RL specific properties <dt-cite key="kos2017delving"></dt-cite><dt-cite key="sun2021who"></dt-cite>.
    The majority of these methods assume that the attacker is able to freely modify the agent's observations, which might not be possible in many cases.
    However, an interesting opportunity arises in multi-agent RL (MARL) settings, where agents observe each other:
  </p>
  <p><i>An attacker might take the form of an agent in MARL, whose actions directly influence the victim's observations.</i></p>
  <p>
    This is the key idea in Gleave et al's paper "Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning" <dt-cite key="gleave2020adversarial"></dt-cite>,
    who train adversarial agents that attack victims in several two-player games.
    In this post, we will take a closer look at those adversarial agents, analyze how they work, and discuss ways to defend against them.
